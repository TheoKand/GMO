GMO foods iPhone Application
-----------------------------

This was a very popular but ill-fated iphone application I released on the App Store in 2013. 

It's a simple catalog of various foods that were included in the yearly report by the Greek branch of Greenpeace. The foods are marked with a color coding depending on the producer's level of commitment to replacing genetically modified ingredients.

The application went viral with little to no advertisement and reached the #1 spot in the "Free Overall" chart of the Greek app store within five days. This translates to roughly 9000 downloads during this period.

After a few days I was contacted by legal representatives of various companies included in the list, and they informed me that the list is outdated and therefore the application should be pulled from the app store.
