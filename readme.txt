GMO foods iPhone Application
-----------------------------

This was a very popular but ill-fated iphone application I developed in 2012. 

It's a simple catalog of various foods that were included in the yearly report by the Greeek branch of Greenpeace. The foods are marked with a color coding depending on the producer's level of commitment to replacing genetically modified ingredients.

The application went viral with little to no advertisement and reached the #1 place in the "Free Overall" chart of the Greek app store within a few days. This goes to show the level of interest by consumers.

After a few days I was contacted by legal representatives of various companies included in the list, and they informed me that the list is outdated and i must remove it or else.
